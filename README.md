# fec_linker
Using the bulk public data downloadable here https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data from the FEC I have created a script to link all donations to and from politicians together. Sadly this large of a network is impossible to render and use so its just a pretty piture for now.
